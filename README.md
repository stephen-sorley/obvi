This is a basic 3D object viewer. Wrote it mainly to practice Qt and CMake, and to create an example of
modern best practices for CMake that I can refer to later.

Currently only tested to build on Windows 10 / VS2017 and Ubuntu 18.04 / GCC 7.3.  I'll probably include
support for Appveyor at a later date.
