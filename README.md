A basic 3D object viewer. Written mainly to get back into practice with Qt, CMake, and modern C++, and to create an example that I can refer to later.

Currently only tested to build on Windows 10 / VS2017 and Ubuntu 18.04 / GCC 7.3.  I'll probably include
support for a CI system like AppVeyor at a later date.


Third-party dependencies
------------------------
Catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): header-only unit testing framework (bundled into repo)
Qt (https://www.qt.io/download): cross-platform GUI library
